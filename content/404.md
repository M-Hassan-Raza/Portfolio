# 404 - Page Not Found

You've reached a place that doesn't exist. Maybe the page was moved, deleted, or never existed in the first place (peak gaslighting).

### Here’s what you can do:
- **[Go back to the homepage](/)** and start over.
- **[Explore my projects](/projects/)** to see my work.
- **[Contact me](/contact/)** if you need assistance.

Or you can stay here and ponder the orb. The choice is yours.
