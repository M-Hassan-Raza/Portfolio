### Hi, I'm Muhammad Hassan Raza 👋

I’m a Software Engineer with a passion for solving complex problems, building things from scratch, and breaking things just to see how they work. I thrive on challenges and believe that the best way to learn is by diving headfirst into the deep end. Whether it’s debugging a stubborn piece of code or designing a high-performance application, I’m always ready to roll up my sleeves and get my hands dirty—preferably with some heavy metal music blasting in the background.

#### 🎓 Education & Learning Journey

I’m currently pursuing a degree in **Software Engineering** at **FAST NUCES**, where I’ve been honing my skills in everything from software quality and web engineering to project management. My academic journey has been a mix of structured learning and self-driven exploration. I’ve always been the kind of person who’s not satisfied with just the textbook answer—I want to know *why* things work the way they do and how I can push them to their limits.

Before diving into the world of software, I completed my **A-Levels** at **Beaconhouse Johar Town**, where I developed a strong foundation in Computer Science, Mathematics, and Physics. These subjects taught me the importance of logical thinking and problem-solving, skills that have become the cornerstone of my engineering career.

#### 💻 Projects & Passion for Building

I’ve always been a builder at heart. Whether it’s creating a high-performance image editor in C++ or designing an advanced malware obfuscation tool like **PixelCryptor**, I love the process of turning ideas into reality. Here are a few projects that I’m particularly proud of:

- **PixelCryptor (2023)**: An advanced malware obfuscation tool that I designed and implemented from scratch. I handled both the backend and frontend development using Django and deployed it securely on Microsoft Azure. This project was a deep dive into cybersecurity and cloud computing, two areas I’m incredibly passionate about.

- **Linear Model Solver (2022)**: A tool built using CustomTkinter and PulP to perform critical path analysis and resource optimization. It was a challenging project that required a solid understanding of linear programming and UI design.

- **Image OCR (2021)**: A simple yet effective application that uses Tkinter and PyTesseract to create snapshots and export transcripts. This project was my first real foray into the world of optical character recognition and image processing.

- **Image Editor (2021)**: A high-performance image editing application built in C++. It included features like mean/median filtering, translation, scaling, and quantization. This project taught me the importance of optimizing code for performance, especially when dealing with large datasets.

#### 🛠️ Work Experience

In the summer of 2023, I had the opportunity to work as a **Software Engineering Intern** at **Arrivy, Inc.**, where I developed the backend for their in-house Employee Management System. I used **BigQuery** and **Flask** to provide server-side functionality and leveraged **GCP Cloud Functions** and **GCP Scheduler** to automate their notification system. This experience gave me a deeper understanding of cloud computing and backend development, and it was incredibly rewarding to see my work directly impact the company’s operations.

#### 🏆 Achievements & Recognition

I’ve been fortunate to receive recognition for my work and dedication over the years. Some of my proudest achievements include:

- **Dean's List of Honors (Fall 2023)**: A testament to my academic performance and commitment to excellence.
- **3rd Place at NaSCon'22 Code Studio Competition**: A coding competition that pushed my problem-solving skills to the limit.
- **4th Place at NaSCon'23 UI/UX Competition**: A recognition of my growing interest in user experience and interface design.
- **VIP Management Team Lead at FutureFest'23**: An opportunity to lead a team and manage high-profile guests at one of Pakistan’s largest tech festivals.

#### 🏛️ Organizations & Leadership

I believe in giving back to the community and have been actively involved in various organizations throughout my academic career:

- **SOFTEC (2020 - Present)**: As the Vice President of Operations and Management, I’ve been responsible for overseeing the planning and execution of one of Pakistan’s largest tech festivals.
- **Cogent Labs (2023)**: I served as a Campus Ambassador and Affiliate, helping to bridge the gap between students and industry professionals.
- **Google Developer Student Clubs (2022)**: As the Media Advisor and Director General, I played a key role in promoting tech events and workshops on campus.
- **Teaching Assistant at FAST NUCES**: I’ve had the privilege of assisting with courses like **Introduction to Software Engineering**, **Software Engineering**, and **Software for Mobile Devices**. Teaching has been a rewarding experience that has deepened my understanding of these subjects.

#### � Skills & Tools

Over the years, I’ve developed a diverse skill set that includes:

- **Programming Languages**: Python, Kotlin (Jetpack Compose), C++
- **Web Development**: ReactJS, Django
- **Cloud Computing**: Google Cloud Platform (GCP), BigQuery, Microsoft Azure
- **Project Management**: GitHub, Agile methodologies
- **Other Tools**: Tkinter, PyTesseract, Flask

#### 🌍 Languages

I’m fluent in both **English** and **Urdu**, which has allowed me to communicate effectively in both local and international settings.

#### 🎸 Interests & Hobbies

When I’m not coding, you can find me:

- Listening to **metal music** (the heavier, the better)
- Exploring the world of **reverse engineering** and cybersecurity
- Tinkering with **Linux** and experimenting with different distros
- Reading about **magnetars and neutron stars** (because who doesn’t love a good cosmic mystery?)
- Contributing to **open-source projects** and collaborating with like-minded developers

#### 🚀 What’s Next?

I’m always on the lookout for new challenges and opportunities to grow. Whether it’s diving deeper into cloud scalability, exploring the intricacies of project management, or contributing to cutting-edge open-source projects, I’m excited to see where my journey takes me next.
