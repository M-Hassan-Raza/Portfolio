### Hi, I'm Muhammad Hassan Raza ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a **Software Engineer** and **CEO** with a passion for building clean, secure, and scalable software. I thrive on solving complex technical challenges and implementing efficient solutions that not only enhance performance but also stand the test of time. My mantra? **No technical debt.** I believe in writing code thatâ€™s maintainable, robust, and future-proofâ€”because nobody wants to deal with a mess down the road.

When Iâ€™m not coding or leading my team at **ChronoPOS**, youâ€™ll probably find me listening to **metal music**, tinkering with **Linux**, or diving into the mysteries of **space and extraterrestrial life**. Iâ€™m a lifelong learner, always exploring new technologies, methodologies, and ways to push the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible.

#### Education & Continuous Learning

Iâ€™m currently pursuing an **MS in Computer Science** at **FAST NUCES Lahore**, where Iâ€™m diving deeper into advanced topics in algorithms, research methodology, and computer architecture. Before this, I completed my **BS in Software Engineering** from the same institution, graduating with a **3.30 GPA**. My academic journey has been a blend of structured learning and self-driven exploration, with coursework in **Software Quality**, **Software Project Engineering**, and **Management**.

Education, for me, is not just about degreesâ€”itâ€™s about the constant pursuit of knowledge. Whether itâ€™s through formal education, online courses, or hands-on projects, Iâ€™m always looking to expand my skill set and stay ahead of the curve.

#### Projects & Building Scalable Solutions

Iâ€™ve always been a builder at heart. From designing advanced malware obfuscation tools to creating high-performance POS systems, I love turning ideas into reality. Here are a few projects that Iâ€™m particularly proud of:

- **PixelCryptor (2023)**: An advanced malware obfuscation tool that I designed and implemented from scratch. I handled both the backend and frontend development, deploying it securely on **Microsoft Azure**. This project was a deep dive into cybersecurity and cloud computing, two areas Iâ€™m incredibly passionate about.

- **Linear Model Solver (2022)**: A tool built using **CustomTkinter** and **PuLP** to perform critical path analysis and resource optimization. It was a challenging project that required a solid understanding of linear programming and UI design.

- **ChronoPOS (2024 - Present)**: As the **CEO** of ChronoPOS, Iâ€™ve led the development of a secure, scalable Point-of-Sale (POS) software for retail businesses. The system streamlines sales, ledger management, and order processing, handling over **Rs. 48 million** in transactions. Key achievements include:
  - Successfully deploying a POS system with integrated inventory management, automating stock tracking and order processing.
  - Implementing automated ledger management, streamlining financial transactions and ensuring accurate records.
  - Developing and launching a refund processing feature.
  - Processing **Rs. 8.6 million** in average monthly transactions, improving sales efficiency by **62%** through reduced checkout times and minimized error rates.

#### Work Experience

- **CEO, ChronoPOS (2024 - Present)**: Leading the development and deployment of a cutting-edge POS system thatâ€™s transforming retail operations in Pakistan. My role involves overseeing product development, managing a team, and ensuring the software meets the highest standards of security and scalability.

- **Software Engineering Intern, Arrivy, Inc. (2023)**: During my internship, I developed the backend for an in-house Employee Management System, replacing an expensive proprietary solution. I used **BigQuery**, **Flask**, and **GCP Scheduler** to provide server-side functionality and automate the notification system. This experience gave me a deeper understanding of cloud computing and backend development.

#### Achievements & Recognition

Iâ€™ve been fortunate to receive recognition for my work and dedication over the years. Some of my proudest achievements include:

- **Dean's List of Honors (Fall 2023, Spring 2024)**: A testament to my academic performance and commitment to excellence.
- **3rd Place at NaSCon'22 Code Studio Competition**: A coding competition that pushed my problem-solving skills to the limit.
- **4th Place at NaSCon'23 UI/UX Competition**: A recognition of my growing interest in user experience and interface design.
- **VIP Management Team Lead at FutureFest'23**: An opportunity to lead a team and manage high-profile guests at one of Pakistanâ€™s largest tech festivals.

#### Organizations & Leadership

I believe in giving back to the community and have been actively involved in various organizations throughout my academic and professional career:

- **FAST NUCES (2020 - 2024)**: As a Teaching Assistant, Iâ€™ve assisted with courses like **Introduction to Software Engineering**, **Software Engineering**, **Software for Mobile Devices**, **Information Security**, and **Fundamentals of Software Project Management**. Teaching has been a rewarding experience that has deepened my understanding of these subjects.

- **SOFTEC (2020 - 2024)**: As the Vice President of Operations and Management, Iâ€™ve been responsible for overseeing the planning and execution of one of Pakistanâ€™s largest tech festivals.

- **Google Developer Student Clubs (2022)**: As the Media Advisor and Director General, I played a key role in promoting tech events and workshops on campus.

#### Skills & Tools

Over the years, Iâ€™ve developed a diverse skill set that includes:

- **Programming Languages**: Python, Java, Kotlin (Jetpack Compose), C++
- **Web Development**: Django, VueJS, Flask
- **Cloud Computing**: Google Cloud Platform (GCP), BigQuery, Microsoft Azure, DigitalOcean VPS
- **Project Management**: GitHub, Agile methodologies
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL

#### Languages

Iâ€™m fluent in both **English** and **Urdu**, which has allowed me to communicate effectively in both local and international settings.

#### Interests & Hobbies

When Iâ€™m not coding or leading my team, you can find me:

- Listening to **metal music** (the heavier, the better)
- Exploring the world of **Linux** and experimenting with different distros
- Reading about **space and extraterrestrial life** (because who doesnâ€™t love a good cosmic mystery?)
- Contributing to **open-source projects** and collaborating with like-minded developers
- Writing about tech and software engineering on my blog

#### Whatâ€™s Next?

Iâ€™m always on the lookout for new challenges and opportunities to grow. Whether itâ€™s diving deeper into cloud scalability, exploring the intricacies of project management, or contributing to cutting-edge open-source projects, Iâ€™m excited to see where my journey takes me next.
