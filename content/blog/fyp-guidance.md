## Introduction

Your **Final Year Project (FYP)** is one of the most important academic tasks in your degree. It can shape your future career, boost your portfolio, and improve your problem-solving skills.  
This guide will help you **choose the right topic, advisor, tech stack, and strategy** to ensure your FYP stands out.

---

## How to Choose a Topic  

Picking the right topic is **critical** for a successful FYP. A good topic should be:  

- **Interesting**: Choose something you're passionate about. No one wants to work on a boring project, let alone for a whole year.  
- **Feasible**: Consider your time, skills, and available resources. Scope is one of the most important factors when it comes to your FYP. It will dictate your life for the next year. And what's more? It will be the first thing your advisor(s) and the evaluation committee will ask you about.
- **Relevant**: Align with industry trends or research needs. As an example, I am an avid "AI" pessimist but I can't deny the fact that it's the hottest trend in the industry right now. So, if you're into AI, you might want to consider a project in that domain. Look at the the recent explosion of AI Agents and Generative AI. Obviously I have many concerns about the ethical implications of these technologies but that's a topic for another day. You want a skillset that's in demand, or at the very least will allow you to have a good conversation with a potential employer.
- **Problem-Solving**: Your project should **address a real problem** or **offer innovation**. Please don't just build another e-commerce website or a basic recommendation system. Building a novel project will not only make you stand out but also give you a sense of accomplishment (and probably a few sleepless nights but you're a FASTian, it's your life anyway). I built a relatively straightforward business project for my FYP and while I'm proud of the work me and my team did and we managed to win a prize for the idea, I can't help but feel like I could have done more.

**Tip:** Browse research papers, GitHub projects, and tech blogs for inspiration.  Look at what the students from foreign universities are doing. They're not necessarily smarter than you but they have access to better resources and they're more likely to be working on cutting-edge projects. You don't have to copy them, but you should never give up on the opportunity to learn from them.

## How to Choose an Advisor  

Your advisor plays a **huge** role in your project's success. A good advisor should be:  

- **Experienced in your chosen field**If your idea is novel enough and complex enough, you might want to consider an advisor who has experience in that domain. They can guide you better and help you avoid common pitfalls. A good example of this are the HODs who excel in their respective fields. They're usually very busy but if you can get them to agree to be your advisor, you're in for a treat. However, there are many many other faculty members who are just as good (if not better, considering they have more time to dedicate to you) and you should consider them as well.
- **Responsive and willing to guide you properly**.  This is a big one. You don't want an advisor who's too busy to meet with you or doesn't respond to your emails. And let me be clear, this isn't a slight against any of the faculty members. They're all extremely helpful and knowledgeable. But some of them are just too busy to give you the attention you need. And here is where clear communication with your potential advisor comes in. You need to be upfront about your expectations and ask them about theirs. This ends up saving a lot of time and effort in the long run.
- **Supportive of your ideas but also critical when needed**.  

**How to find one?**  
- Check faculty profiles and see their published work.  
- Ask seniors about their experiences with different advisors.  
- Approach multiple advisors with a **short, well-prepared proposal**.

## How to Choose a Tech Stack  

Your tech stack should be **practical and aligned with your project's scope**. Consider:  

- **Industry Demand**: Is the tech widely used (e.g., Python, React, Django)?  
- **Scalability**: Can your tech handle future growth?  
- **Learning Curve**: Will you have time to master it?  

**Example Tech Stacks:**  
- **Web Apps**: Vue.js / React + Django / Node.js + PostgreSQL  
- **AI/ML**: Python (TensorFlow, PyTorch) + Flask / FastAPI  
- **Mobile Apps**: Flutter / React Native  

**Tip:** Stick to technologies you are comfortable with or have enough time to learn.

## Can an FYP Help with Employment and Master's Admissions?  

Absolutely! A **well-executed FYP** can:  

- **Impress recruiters**: Companies prefer candidates who have built real-world projects.  
- **Boost your resume & portfolio**: Especially if it’s on GitHub with good documentation.  
- **Support your Master's application**: A strong project with a research component can help in admissions and scholarships.  

**Tip:** Try to publish a **paper** or present your project in a **competition** for extra credibility.

## How to Write an Effective FYP Proposal  

A solid proposal increases your chances of approval. It should include:  

- **Project Title**: Clear and concise.  
- **Problem Statement**: What issue are you solving?  
- **Objectives**: Define clear, measurable goals.  
- **Tech Stack**: Justify your choice of tools.  
- **Expected Outcomes**: What impact will your project have?  

**Tip:** Avoid overly ambitious goals—keep it realistic and achievable.

## Project Management and Development Best Practices  

Managing your project efficiently ensures smooth progress.  

- **Use Agile/Scrum**: Break work into small, manageable tasks.  
- **Version Control**: Use Git/GitHub for tracking changes.  
- **Task Management**: Use Trello, Notion, or Jira for planning.  
- **Code Documentation**: Write clean, well-commented code for maintainability.  

**Tip:** Meet with your team/advisor **weekly** to track progress.  

---

## Testing and Deployment Considerations  

Testing is often **ignored** but is **critical** for project success.  

- **Unit Testing**: Test small components of your project.  
- **Integration Testing**: Ensure different modules work together.  
- **Performance Testing**: Check for scalability and speed.  
- **Deployment**: Choose a reliable platform (AWS, Firebase, Heroku).  

**Tip:** Automate testing using **CI/CD pipelines** if possible.  

---

## How to Prepare for the FYP Defense  

Your **FYP defense** is where you showcase your hard work. A great presentation includes:  

- **Clear project demo**: Avoid unnecessary details, focus on key features.  
- **Performance insights**: Show efficiency improvements, benchmarking.  
- **Common questions handling**: Prepare for expected technical and theoretical questions.  

**Tip:** **Practice** your defense multiple times before presenting.  

---

## Conclusion  

Your FYP is more than just an academic requirement—it’s a **launchpad** for your career.  

- Choose **the right topic and tech stack**.  
- Work with **a supportive advisor**.  
- Follow **best coding & project management practices**.  
- Use it to **boost your resume and career prospects**.  

**Final Tip:** Start early, be consistent, and seek feedback from peers and advisors.
