## Introduction

Your **Final Year Project (FYP)** is one of the most important academic tasks in your degree. It can shape your future career, boost your portfolio, and improve your problem-solving skills.  
This guide will help you **choose the right topic, advisor, tech stack, and strategy** to ensure your FYP stands out.

---

## How to Choose a Topic  

Picking the right topic is **critical** for a successful FYP. A good topic should be:  

- **Interesting**: Choose something you're passionate about. No one wants to work on a boring project, let alone for a whole year.  
- **Feasible**: Consider your time, skills, and available resources. Scope is one of the most important factors when it comes to your FYP. It will dictate your life for the next year. And what's more? It will be the first thing your advisor(s) and the evaluation committee will ask you about.
- **Relevant**: Align with industry trends or research needs. As an example, I am an avid "AI" pessimist but I can't deny the fact that it's the hottest trend in the industry right now. So, if you're into AI, you might want to consider a project in that domain. Look at the the recent explosion of AI Agents and Generative AI. Obviously I have many concerns about the ethical implications of these technologies but that's a topic for another day. You want a skillset that's in demand, or at the very least will allow you to have a good conversation with a potential employer.
- **Problem-Solving**: Your project should **address a real problem** or **offer innovation**. Please don't just build another e-commerce website or a basic recommendation system. Building a novel project will not only make you stand out but also give you a sense of accomplishment (and probably a few sleepless nights but you're a FASTian, it's your life anyway). I built a relatively straightforward business project for my FYP and while I'm proud of the work me and my team did and we managed to win a prize for the idea, I can't help but feel like I could have done more.

**Tip:** Browse research papers, GitHub projects, and tech blogs for inspiration.  Look at what the students from foreign universities are doing. They're not necessarily smarter than you but they have access to better resources and they're more likely to be working on cutting-edge projects. You don't have to copy them, but you should never give up on the opportunity to learn from them.

## How to Choose an Advisor  

Your advisor plays a **huge** role in your project's success. A good advisor should be:  

- **Experienced in your chosen field**: If your idea is novel enough and complex enough, you might want to consider an advisor who has experience in that domain. They can guide you better and help you avoid common pitfalls. A good example of this are the HODs who excel in their respective fields. They're usually very busy but if you can get them to agree to be your advisor, you're in for a treat. However, there are many many other faculty members who are just as good (if not better, considering they have more time to dedicate to you) and you should consider them as well.
- **Responsive and willing to guide you properly**: This is a big one. You don't want an advisor who's too busy to meet with you or doesn't respond to your emails. And let me be clear, this isn't a slight against any of the faculty members. They're all extremely helpful and knowledgeable. But some of them are just too busy to give you the attention you need. And here is where clear communication with your potential advisor comes in. You need to be upfront about your expectations and ask them about theirs. This ends up saving a lot of time and effort in the long run.
- **Supportive of your ideas but also critical when needed**: Everyone loves a chill time but you shouldn't try to chill with your FYP. You need someone who can guide you properly and point out the flaws in your project. You need someone who can push you to do better (even against your will hahaha). You need someone who can be your mentor. And you need someone who can be your friend. And you need someone who can be your critic. And you need someone who can be your cheerleader. That was a lot of "ands" but you get the point. FAST is filled with faculty members who can be all of these things and more. You just need to find the right one for you.

**How to find one?**  
- Check faculty profiles and see their published work.  
- Ask seniors about their experiences with different advisors. This is the most important one. Seniors can give you the best advice on who to choose as your advisor. They've been through the process and they know who's good and who's not. But still, they can be biased towards or against certain faculty members so take their advice with a grain of salt. Maybe the advisor who was too strict for them is the perfect fit for you.
- Approach multiple advisors with a **short, well-prepared proposal**. Get a printed copy please. It's a small thing but it shows that you're serious about your project. And it's a good habit to get into. You should always have a printed copy of your proposal, your project plan, your project report, your project presentation, your project defense, your project... you get the point.

## How to Choose a Tech Stack  

Your tech stack should be **practical and aligned with your project's scope**. Consider:  

- **Industry Demand**: Is the tech widely used (e.g., Python, React, Django)?  
- **Scalability**: Can your tech handle future growth? Let me be clear, not all projects need to be scalable. If you're building a project that's meant to be used by a small group of people, scalability might not be a concern for you. But if you're building a project that's meant to be used by a large group of people, scalability should be one of your top concerns. So please *don't over-engineer or under-engineer your project*. I have a habit of designing the projects (even hobby ones) that can scale to thousands of users. But that's not always necessary. 
- **Learning Curve**: Will you have time to master it?  FASTians are built different. They can learn anything in a short amount of time. But that doesn't mean you should try to learn everything. You should stick to what you know and what you can learn in a reasonable amount of time. You don't want to be learning a new language or framework in the middle of your project. That's a recipe for disaster. Imagine flying a plane with your right while holding the manual in your left. However, if you have some time before your FYP starts, you can use that time to learn a new language or framework. 

**Example Tech Stacks:**  
- **Web Apps**: Vue.js / Django / PostgreSQL. I love this stack. It's simple, it's powerful, and it's easy to learn. 
- **AI/ML**: Python (TensorFlow, PyTorch) + Flask / FastAPI  
- **Mobile Apps**: Kotlin / Swift. I prefer native apps as compared to hybrid apps. But that's just me. You might prefer hybrid apps and that's perfectly fine. I want to squeeze every bit of performance out of my apps. But you might not care about that.

**Tip:** Stick to technologies you are comfortable with or have enough time to learn.

## Can an FYP Help with Employment and Master's Admissions?  

Absolutely! A **well-executed FYP** can:  

- **Impress recruiters**: Companies prefer candidates who have built real-world projects that they can check out. 
- **Boost your resume & portfolio**: Especially if it’s on GitHub with good documentation. code quality, a working demo, and a good commit history. 
- **Support your Master's application**: A strong project with a research component can help in admissions and scholarships.  

**Tip:** Try to publish a **paper** or present your project in a **competition** for extra credibility.

## How to Write an Effective FYP Proposal  

A solid proposal increases your chances of approval. It should include:  

- **Project Title**: Clear and concise.  
- **Problem Statement**: What issue are you solving?  
- **Objectives**: Define clear, measurable goals. Don't just say things like "I want to build a website". Say things like "I want to build a website that allows users to do X, Y, and Z".
- **Tech Stack**: Justify your choice of tools. This shows that you've researched your project and you know what you're doing. For example, why did you choose one database over another? Why did you choose one language over another? Why did you choose one framework over another?
- **Expected Outcomes**: What impact will your project have? Obviously it's mostly speculation at this point but you should have a good idea of what you want to achieve with your project.  

**Tip:** Avoid overly ambitious goals—keep it realistic and achievable. As the saying goes, "Underpromise and overdeliver". Underpromising doesn't work if the project is too simple. But overpromising can be a disaster.

## Project Management and Development Best Practices  

Managing your project efficiently ensures smooth progress.  

- **Use Agile/Scrum**: Break work into small, manageable tasks.  
- **Version Control**: Use Git/GitHub for tracking changes. For the love of all that's holy, don't send each other code files over WhatsApp. Use Git. It's not that hard to learn and it will save you a lot of time and effort.
- **Task Management**: Use Trello, Notion, or Jira for planning. You can mostly get away with using Trello. It's simple, it's easy to use, and it's free. But if you want more features, you can use Notion or Jira. 
- **Code Documentation**: Write clean, well-commented code for maintainability. Look into the tools that can help you with this. For example, you can use JSDoc for JavaScript, Sphinx for Python, and Doxygen for C++.
- **Usecase based development**: Develop your project based on the use cases divided amongst each member. Don't commit the cardinal sin of assigning a whole layer to a single member (my X member did the frontend). This is a recipe for disaster. 

**Tip:** Meet with your team/advisor **weekly** to track progress.

## Testing and Deployment Considerations  

Testing is often **ignored** but is **critical** for project success.  

- **Unit Testing**: Test small components of your project.  
- **Integration Testing**: Ensure different modules work together.  
- **Performance Testing**: Check for scalability and speed. Look into skeleton loading, lazy loading, and other performance optimization techniques. 
- **Deployment**: Choose a reliable platform (AWS, Firebase, Heroku, DigitalOcean). I always recommend a VPS. It's cheaper and setting up your own deployment pipeline is a great learning experience. 

**Tip:** Automate testing using **CI/CD pipelines** if possible.

## How to Prepare for the FYP Defense  

Your **FYP defense** is where you showcase your hard work. A great presentation includes:  

- **Clear project demo**: Avoid unnecessary details, focus on key features.  
- **Performance insights**: Show efficiency improvements, benchmarking.  
- **Common questions handling**: Prepare for expected technical and theoretical questions.  

**Tip:** **Practice** your defense multiple times before presenting. Make sure all the members know all the details of the project. You don't want to be caught off guard by a question you should know the answer to. If there's one smart person in the room, they'll always target the other members to look for weakness.

## Conclusion  

Your FYP is more than just an academic requirement—it’s a **launchpad** for your career.  

- Choose **the right topic and tech stack**.  
- Work with **a supportive advisor**.  
- Follow **best coding & project management practices**.  
- Use it to **boost your resume and career prospects**.  

**Final Tip:** Start early, be consistent, and seek feedback from peers and advisors.
