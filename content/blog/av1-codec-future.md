For years, H.264 has been the backbone of video streaming, but the industry is moving toward AV1—a more efficient, royalty-free codec designed for the future. I believe it’s only a matter of time before major streaming platforms fully transition to AV1. I have no biases towards any codecs. I still listen to flac music despite noticing no difference in quality comapred to 320kbps MP3 (or maybe it's the hearing damage from listening to brutal music for more than a decade :D) but I believe AV1 is the future of video streaming.

## Why AV1?
- **Better Compression** – AV1 offers up to 50% better compression than H.264 while maintaining the same visual quality, meaning smaller file sizes and less bandwidth usage.
- **Royalty-Free** – Unlike HEVC (H.265), AV1 is open-source and doesn’t require licensing fees, making it attractive for companies looking to cut costs.
- **Improved Quality** – At lower bitrates, AV1 provides superior image quality compared to older codecs.
- **Future-Proof** – With 8K and HDR becoming more common, AV1 is built to handle high-resolution content efficiently.

## Industry Adoption
Many major players like YouTube, Netflix, and Twitch have already started using AV1 for select content, especially in bandwidth-constrained scenarios. As hardware support improves, I predict a rapid shift away from H.264 in favor of AV1.

## The Road Ahead
Right now, AV1 decoding is mainly software-based, which can be slow on older devices. However, newer GPUs and mobile chips are integrating AV1 hardware acceleration, making widespread adoption inevitable. Within the next few years, I expect AV1 to become the default for most streaming services.

AV1 isn’t just a niche experiment—it’s the future of video streaming. The sooner platforms embrace it, the better streaming quality and efficiency will be for everyone.
