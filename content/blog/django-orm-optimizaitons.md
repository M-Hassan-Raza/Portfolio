## Introduction

As my POS system scaled, performance bottlenecks became increasingly apparent. Customers began complaining about slow bill generation times, which made checkout frustratingly sluggish. After profiling my Django APIs, I discovered that inefficient ORM queries were causing unnecessary database overhead, leading to significant slowdowns. This prompted a deep dive into ORM optimizations to reduce query execution time and improve the overall user experience.

In this post, I'll share how I optimized my Django ORM queries using `select_related`, `prefetch_related`, bulk operations, and query profiling tools to enhance the efficiency of my refund API and bill generation process.

## The N+1 Query Problem and Its Impact

One major issue I faced was the **N+1 query problem**, which happens when querying related objects in a loop, leading to excessive database hits.

For example, in my refund API:

```python
for item_data in refund_items_data:
    bill_item = BillItem.objects.get(id=item_data["bill_item_id"])
    product = bill_item.product  # This triggers a separate query each time
```

Since each iteration fetched a related `product` separately, it resulted in multiple queries—one for each `bill_item`. When processing large refunds, this approach led to severe slowdowns.

### Solution: Using `select_related` for ForeignKey Joins

Replacing individual lookups with `select_related` drastically reduced query counts by using SQL joins to fetch related data in a single query:

```python
for item_data in refund_items_data:
    bill_item = BillItem.objects.select_related('product').get(id=item_data["bill_item_id"])
    product = bill_item.product  # Now fetched in the same query
```

This improved performance by minimizing redundant database hits.

## Optimizing Many-to-Many Queries with `prefetch_related`

Another issue arose when fetching refund items along with related `bill_items` and `products`. Since Django’s ORM performs multiple queries for Many-to-Many relationships, `prefetch_related` was a better choice than `select_related`.

```python
refund_items = RefundItem.objects.prefetch_related('bill_item__product').filter(refund=refund)
```

This preloads related objects efficiently, reducing database queries and improving response times.

## When to Use Raw SQL vs. Django ORM

Django ORM is powerful, but sometimes raw SQL is necessary for complex aggregations. For instance, if I needed to sum refunded amounts efficiently, a raw SQL query would outperform multiple ORM calls:

```python
from django.db import connection

def get_total_refunded_amount(refund_id):
    with connection.cursor() as cursor:
        cursor.execute("""
            SELECT SUM(refunded_amount) FROM refund_item WHERE refund_id = %s
        """, [refund_id])
        return cursor.fetchone()[0]
```

This direct approach was faster than filtering and aggregating with Django ORM in certain scenarios.

## Efficient Bulk Inserts and Updates

Handling refunds involved updating multiple products at once. Initially, I updated each product inside a loop, leading to excessive database writes:

```python
for product in products_to_update:
    product.save()
```

Switching to `bulk_update` allowed batch updates, significantly improving performance:

```python
Product.objects.bulk_update(products_to_update, ["quantity_units", "quantity_subunits"])
```

Similarly, `bulk_create` was useful for inserting multiple refund items efficiently:

```python
RefundItem.objects.bulk_create(refund_items)
```

## Profiling Queries with Django Debug Toolbar and Silk

To identify bottlenecks, I used **Django Debug Toolbar** and **Silk**:

1. **Django Debug Toolbar**
   - Installed via:
     ```sh
     pip install django-debug-toolbar
     ```
   - Added to `INSTALLED_APPS` and middleware, it revealed query counts and execution times.

2. **Silk**
   - Installed via:
     ```sh
     pip install django-silk
     ```
   - Enabled query logging, helping me pinpoint slow database operations.

These tools were invaluable in detecting inefficient queries and refining my ORM usage.

## Results and Performance Gains

After implementing these optimizations, the refund API saw **a 70% reduction in query execution time**, significantly improving bill generation speed. Customers immediately noticed smoother transactions, and complaints about slow processing vanished.

## Conclusion

Optimizing Django ORM queries is crucial for scaling large applications. By leveraging `select_related`, `prefetch_related`, bulk operations, and profiling tools, I was able to fine-tune my APIs for high performance. If you're experiencing slow database operations, consider these strategies to improve efficiency and responsiveness in your Django projects. These techniques ended up saving my business from potential losses (customer were fuming a little ngl) due to poor user experience, and I'm confident they can help you too.
