<p class="author">Author: Robert Nystrom</p>
<blockquote class="review">
Most don't care about how their code gets executed, but they should. This book takes you from <strong>lexing, parsing, and ASTs</strong> to building a full interpreter from scratch. Writing a line that looks like English and making it do things is pure magic. Every programmer should go through that <strong>euphoric feeling</strong> at least once.
