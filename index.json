[{"content":"Introduction When dealing with financial transactions in Django applications, maintaining an accurate ledger is critical. However, inefficient signal handling can lead to performance bottlenecks. In this article, we\u0026rsquo;ll explore an optimized approach to recalculating ledger balances while ensuring minimal database impact.\nThe Problem A typical ledger system requires recalculating balances when transactions are inserted, updated, or deleted. Using Django signals, many implementations trigger redundant recalculations, causing excessive database queries and slowing down the application.\nCommon Issues with Signals: Unnecessary Queries: Each save or delete operation triggers a recalculation, even if no meaningful change occurs. Cascade Effects: Bulk operations lead to multiple redundant recalculations. Performance Overhead: Large transaction volumes cause significant slowdowns. Optimized Approach To address these inefficiencies, we introduce a flag-based recalculation strategy that minimizes unnecessary database interactions.\nStep 1: Adding a Recalculation Flag Instead of recalculating every time a transaction is saved, we introduce a _needs_recalc flag:\nfrom django.db import models from django.db.models.signals import post_save, post_delete from django.dispatch import receiver class Transaction(models.Model): amount = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2) ledger = models.ForeignKey(\u0026#39;Ledger\u0026#39;, on_delete=models.CASCADE) def save(self, *args, **kwargs): self.ledger._needs_recalc = True super().save(*args, **kwargs) @receiver(post_delete, sender=Transaction) def mark_ledger_for_recalc(sender, instance, **kwargs): instance.ledger._needs_recalc = True Step 2: Efficient Ledger Recalculation Recalculating balances should only occur when necessary, ideally after all related operations are complete:\nfrom django.db import transaction def recalculate_ledger_balances(): ledgers_to_update = Ledger.objects.filter(_needs_recalc=True) for ledger in ledgers_to_update: ledger.recalculate_balance() ledger._needs_recalc = False ledger.save(update_fields=[\u0026#39;balance\u0026#39;]) Step 3: Using Post-Transaction Hooks Using Djangoâ€™s on_commit() ensures recalculations only happen after successful transactions:\nfrom django.db.transaction import on_commit @receiver(post_save, sender=Transaction) def trigger_ledger_recalc(sender, instance, **kwargs): on_commit(lambda: recalculate_ledger_balances()) Performance Gains With this approach, we achieve:\nReduced Queries: Recalculation happens once per affected ledger, not per transaction. Better Scalability: Batch updates improve efficiency. Consistent Data: Using on_commit() ensures recalculations only happen after successful writes. Conclusion By intelligently managing recalculations, we significantly improve the performance of our ledger system in Django applications. This approach ensures efficiency without sacrificing data accuracy, making it ideal for high-volume financial applications.\n","permalink":"https://mhassan.dev/blog/using-signals-optimally/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"introduction\"\u003eIntroduction\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen dealing with financial transactions in Django applications, maintaining an accurate ledger is critical.

When dealing with critical actionsâ€”such as password changes, data deletions, or any irreversible actionsâ€”maintaining consistency is key. Reusable components, like confirmation modals or standardized buttons, ensure that users have a predictable and secure interaction every time.\nBenefits of Reusable Components Reusable components offer several significant advantages:\nConsistency:\nStandardized UI elements, such as confirmation modals or password prompts, ensure that users are always presented with familiar interfaces when performing critical actions. This consistency reduces confusion and builds trust in your application.\nMaintainability:\nWhen a component is reused across multiple parts of an application, any necessary updates or bug fixes need to be implemented only once. This centralization simplifies maintenance and helps avoid discrepancies in the user experience.\nImproved Development Speed:\nOnce a reusable component is created, it can be easily integrated wherever needed. This reduces code duplication and speeds up the development process, allowing you to focus on new features rather than rewriting similar functionality.\nEnhanced Testing:\nWith a single, well-tested component in use throughout your application, you can be confident that critical user interactions work reliably every time, reducing the potential for errors.\nReusable Components in VueJS VueJS\u0026rsquo;s component-based architecture makes it ideal for creating modular, reusable UI elements. Consider the following example of a confirmation modal component:\nConfirmation Modal Component Example This component can be used anywhere you need to confirm a critical action. It accepts customizable properties for the title and message and emits events based on the user\u0026rsquo;s choice.\n\u0026lt;template\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;modal\u0026#34; v-if=\u0026#34;visible\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;modal-content\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h3\u0026gt;{{ title }}\u0026lt;/h3\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;{{ message }}\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;modal-actions\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;button @click=\u0026#34;confirmAction\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Confirm\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; \u0026lt;button @click=\u0026#34;cancelAction\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Cancel\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/template\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; export default { props: { visible: { type: Boolean, default: false }, title: { type: String, default: \u0026#39;Confirm Action\u0026#39; }, message: { type: String, default: \u0026#39;Are you sure you want to proceed?\u0026#39; } }, methods: { confirmAction() { this.$emit(\u0026#39;confirmed\u0026#39;); }, cancelAction() { this.$emit(\u0026#39;cancelled\u0026#39;); } } }; \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;style scoped\u0026gt; .modal { position: fixed; top: 0; left: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0; background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5); display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; } .modal-content { background: #fff; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 4px; width: 100%; max-width: 400px; } .modal-actions { display: flex; justify-content: flex-end; gap: 1rem; } \u0026lt;/style\u0026gt; Additional Reusable Components Password Confirmation Modals:\nSimilar to the confirmation modal above, a password confirmation modal can prompt users to re-enter their password before making critical changes, ensuring security and consistency.\nStandardized Button Components:\nCreating a reusable button component that encapsulates various states (default, hover, active, disabled) helps maintain a consistent look and feel across all critical actions.\nConclusion Building reusable components in VueJS not only streamlines the development process but also enhances the overall user experience. For critical actionsâ€”like confirming deletions or verifying passwordsâ€”a consistent UI is essential to reduce confusion and build user trust. By creating and maintaining reusable components for modals, buttons, and other interface elements, you ensure that your application remains both robust and user-friendly.\nAdopting a component-based approach in VueJS leads to faster development, easier maintenance, and a more consistent interface, all of which are critical for modern web applications. Consider integrating these practices into your next project to see the tangible benefits in both code quality and user satisfaction.\n","permalink":"https://mhassan.dev/blog/reusing-components-benefits/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"introduction\"\u003eIntroduction\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn modern web development, especially with frameworks like VueJS, building reusable components is a best practice that significantly improves both development efficiency and user experience.

One effective strategy to achieve this is preloading data when a page loads. For example, on a generate invoice page, preloading product data upon mounting ensures that users can search through products without any noticeable delay. This article explains the benefits of preloading data and includes a practical code example.\nBenefits of Preloading Data Preloading data on page load offers several key advantages:\nFaster User Interactions:\nWith the data already available in memory, functions like search can filter through products immediately, without waiting for additional network requests.\nReduced Latency:\nEliminating extra API calls during user interactions minimizes delays, leading to a more responsive interface.\nImproved Application Performance:\nBy consolidating data retrieval to the initial page load, network usage is optimized and subsequent operations become faster.\nEnhanced User Experience:\nImmediate feedback during searches and other interactions creates a smoother workflow, increasing overall user satisfaction.\nCode Example Below is a sample code snippet demonstrating how to preload product data on page load and perform a local search on an invoice page. This example uses a setup function (common in Vue.js with the Composition API) to initialize the product store, load products on mount, and filter the products based on a search query.\nsetup() { const authStore = useAuthStore(); const productStore = useProductStore(); // Initialize the product store // Define reactive references for the search query and search results const searchQuery = ref(\u0026#39;\u0026#39;); const searchResults = ref([]); // Function to preload products when the page loads const loadProducts = async () =\u0026gt; { await productStore.fetchProducts(); // Fetch the products and store them }; // Function to search products locally based on the query const searchProducts = () =\u0026gt; { if (searchQuery.value.trim() === \u0026#39;\u0026#39;) { searchResults.value = []; return; } // Filter products using local data based on the search query searchResults.value = productStore.products.filter(product =\u0026gt; { const productName = product.name || \u0026#39;\u0026#39;; // Default to empty string if undefined const productDescription = product.description || \u0026#39;\u0026#39;; // Default to empty string if undefined return productName.toLowerCase().includes(searchQuery.value.toLowerCase()) || productDescription.toLowerCase().includes(searchQuery.value.toLowerCase()); }); }; // Preload products when the component is mounted onMounted(() =\u0026gt; { loadProducts(); }); return { authStore, productStore, searchQuery, searchResults, searchProducts }; }, Explanation of the Code Initialization:\nThe code initializes the authentication and product stores. Reactive references searchQuery and searchResults are declared to manage the user\u0026rsquo;s search input and the results, respectively.\nPreloading Data:\nThe loadProducts function asynchronously fetches products from the product store when the component mounts. This preloading ensures that all product data is available immediately after the page loads.\nLocal Search:\nThe searchProducts function performs local filtering on the preloaded product data. If the search query is empty, it resets the results. Otherwise, it filters the product list based on whether the product\u0026rsquo;s name or description contains the search query.\nonMounted Hook:\nThe onMounted lifecycle hook calls loadProducts, ensuring that the data is fetched as soon as the component is rendered.\nConclusion Preloading data on page load is a powerful technique to enhance performance in web applications. By loading the necessary data upfront, applications can deliver instant feedback for operations such as searches, resulting in a more responsive and efficient user experience. This strategy not only reduces network latency but also improves overall performance by allowing local data operations.\nImplementing such techniques in your projects, especially in critical areas like the generate invoice page, can lead to faster interactions and a more satisfying user experience. Consider adopting preloading methods in your future projects to optimize performance and streamline data access.\n","permalink":"https://mhassan.dev/blog/preloading-data-for-performance/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"introduction\"\u003eIntroduction\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn modern web applications, speed and responsiveness are essential for a smooth user experience.

With a PostgreSQL database and a Django backend, early performance issues arose due to inefficient query patterns, redundant updates, and excessive database hits.\nInitial Problems 1. Slow Bulk Updates Updating multiple records individually in Django was inefficient. Consider this naÃ¯ve approach:\nfor product in products: product.stock -= 1 product.save() This triggered a separate UPDATE query for each product, significantly slowing down batch operations.\n2. Signal Overhead Django signals were initially used to track stock changes, but they fired on every save, leading to unnecessary computations.\n@receiver(post_save, sender=Sale) def update_inventory(sender, instance, **kwargs): product = instance.product product.stock -= instance.quantity product.save() With high transaction volumes, this became a major bottleneck.\n3. Redundant Queries Certain parts of the system, such as product conversion rates (e.g., unit-based conversions), recalculated values every time instead of caching them.\ndef get_conversion_rate(product): return ConversionRate.objects.get(product=product).rate Optimizations Implemented 1. Using bulk_update for Efficiency Instead of saving each instance separately, Djangoâ€™s bulk_update was used to update multiple rows efficiently.\nProduct.objects.bulk_update(products, [\u0026#39;stock\u0026#39;]) This reduced the number of queries from N to 1.\n2. Replacing Signals with Direct Updates Instead of relying on Django signals, updates were performed explicitly in views or services:\nSale.objects.create(product=product, quantity=5) Product.objects.filter(id=product.id).update(stock=F(\u0026#39;stock\u0026#39;) - 5) By using F expressions, updates were performed in a single SQL statement, improving efficiency.\n3. Caching Frequently Accessed Data For product conversion rates, a caching mechanism using Djangoâ€™s built-in cache framework was introduced:\nfrom django.core.cache import cache def get_conversion_rate(product): cache_key = f\u0026#39;conversion_rate_{product.id}\u0026#39; rate = cache.get(cache_key) if rate is None: rate = ConversionRate.objects.get(product=product).rate cache.set(cache_key, rate, timeout=3600) # Cache for 1 hour return rate This reduced redundant database hits and significantly improved response times.\nResults Bulk updates reduced update time from seconds to milliseconds. Eliminating unnecessary signals lowered database write load. Caching reduced redundant queries, leading to faster response times in product-related calculations. Final Thoughts Performance tuning in Django requires a mix of bulk operations, query optimization, and caching. Understanding when to use Djangoâ€™s ORM features efficiently can prevent unnecessary database load and keep the application responsive. This approach significantly improved the speed of a POS system handling thousands of transactions daily.\n","permalink":"https://mhassan.dev/blog/optimizing-django-performance/","summary":"Optimizing Django for a high-traffic POS system required bulk updates, caching, and efficient query strategies.
