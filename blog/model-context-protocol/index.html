Model Context Protocol (MCP) is one of those things.\nIf you’re a developer working with LLMs, MCP will change how you integrate AI into your workflows. Here’s an early-adopter perspective on what it is, why it matters, and how to actually use it.\nWhat Problem Does MCP Solve? Today’s AI tools are context-starved. You paste code into ChatGPT, upload files to Claude, manually copy database schemas into prompts. Every session starts from scratch. Every context window is a blank slate.\nThis is absurd.\nYour IDE knows your codebase. Your browser knows your tabs. Your database has a schema. Why are you the middleman copying information between tools that should talk to each other?\nMCP is a protocol for AI models to access external context sources directly. Instead of “paste your code here,” the model can ask “what files are in this project?” and get an answer.\nIt’s not magic—it’s plumbing. But it’s plumbing that enables magic.\nMCP Architecture for Developers MCP has three components:\n1. MCP Hosts: Applications that want to use AI (Claude Desktop, IDEs, custom apps)\n2. MCP Servers: Programs that expose data/functionality to AI (database connectors, file system access, API wrappers)\n3. The Protocol: JSON-RPC communication between hosts and servers\n┌─────────────┐ MCP Protocol ┌─────────────┐ │ MCP Host │◄───────────────────►│ MCP Server │ │ (Claude) │ JSON-RPC/stdio │ (Your DB) │ └─────────────┘ └─────────────┘ The key insight: MCP servers are just programs that respond to standard queries. You can write one in any language, for any data source.\nHow it differs from function calling Function calling (tool use) lets models invoke specific functions you’ve defined. MCP is broader—it lets models discover what’s available and query it dynamically.\n# Function calling: You predefine everything tools = [ {\"name\": \"get_user\", \"parameters\": {...}}, {\"name\": \"list_orders\", \"parameters\": {...}}, ] # MCP: Model discovers capabilities # \"What resources are available?\" # → [\"users\", \"orders\", \"products\", \"analytics\"] # \"What can I do with users?\" # → [list, get, search, ...] MCP is more flexible, but requires more trust. You’re giving the model keys to explore, not just execute predefined actions.\nBuilding an MCP Server Let’s build a simple MCP server that exposes a PostgreSQL database. This is genuinely useful—suddenly Claude can query your database schema, understand relationships, and help with queries.\n# db_mcp_server.py import asyncio import json from mcp.server import Server from mcp.types import Resource, Tool, TextContent import asyncpg server = Server(\"postgres-explorer\") pool = None @server.list_resources() async def list_resources(): \"\"\"List available database resources.\"\"\" async with pool.acquire() as conn: tables = await conn.fetch(\"\"\" SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public' \"\"\") return [ Resource( uri=f\"postgres://tables/{t['table_name']}\", name=t['table_name'], description=f\"Table: {t['table_name']}\" ) for t in tables ] @server.read_resource() async def read_resource(uri: str): \"\"\"Get schema for a specific table.\"\"\" table_name = uri.split(\"/\")[-1] async with pool.acquire() as conn: columns = await conn.fetch(\"\"\" SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = $1 ORDER BY ordinal_position \"\"\", table_name) schema = \"\\n\".join([ f\" {c['column_name']}: {c['data_type']}\" f\" {'(nullable)' if c['is_nullable'] == 'YES' else ''}\" for c in columns ]) return TextContent( type=\"text\", text=f\"Table: {table_name}\\n\\n{schema}\" ) @server.list_tools() async def list_tools(): \"\"\"Expose query capability as a tool.\"\"\" return [ Tool( name=\"query\", description=\"Execute a read-only SQL query\", inputSchema={ \"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": { \"sql\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"SQL query\"} }, \"required\": [\"sql\"] } ) ] @server.call_tool() async def call_tool(name: str, arguments: dict): \"\"\"Execute the query tool.\"\"\" if name != \"query\": raise ValueError(f\"Unknown tool: {name}\") sql = arguments[\"sql\"] # Safety: only allow SELECT if not sql.strip().upper().startswith(\"SELECT\"): return TextContent( type=\"text\", text=\"Error: Only SELECT queries allowed\" ) async with pool.acquire() as conn: rows = await conn.fetch(sql) return TextContent( type=\"text\", text=json.dumps([dict(r) for r in rows], default=str) ) async def main(): global pool pool = await asyncpg.create_pool( \"postgresql://user:pass@localhost/mydb\" ) await server.run() if __name__ == \"__main__\": asyncio.run(main()) Configure Claude Desktop to use this server:\n// claude_desktop_config.json { \"mcpServers\": { \"postgres\": { \"command\": \"python\", \"args\": [\"/path/to/db_mcp_server.py\"] } } } Now Claude can explore your database schema, understand table relationships, and help write queries—with real context, not guesses.\nUse Cases That Make Sense After building several MCP integrations, here’s where they shine:\nDatabase introspection The example above. Claude understanding your actual schema instead of inventing tables that don’t exist. Worth the setup for any database-heavy work.\nDocumentation access Point an MCP server at your internal docs, and Claude can reference them when answering questions. Better than pasting docs into prompts.\n@server.list_resources() async def list_resources(): docs_path = Path(\"/path/to/docs\") return [ Resource( uri=f\"docs://{p.relative_to(docs_path)}\", name=p.stem, description=f\"Documentation: {p.stem}\" ) for p in docs_path.rglob(\"*.md\") ] Git repository analysis Give Claude read access to your git history. “What changed in the last week?” “Who usually works on this file?” “Show me the commit that introduced this function.”\nExternal API wrappers Wrap frequently-used APIs as MCP tools. Instead of explaining API semantics in every prompt, Claude can discover and call them directly.\nAt Entropy Labs, we built an MCP server for our internal APIs. Now Claude can check deployment status, query metrics, and look up customer data—all without manual copy-paste.\nCurrent Limitations MCP is early-stage. Expect rough edges:\n1. Ecosystem is immature. Pre-built servers exist for common tools (filesystem, GitHub, Slack), but you’ll write custom ones for anything domain-specific.\n2. Security requires thought. MCP servers have access to real systems. A poorly-written server can expose sensitive data or allow unintended actions. Audit carefully.\n3. Performance varies. Large resource lists or slow database queries can delay responses. Implement timeouts and pagination.\n4. Discovery UX is evolving. Models don’t always explore available resources effectively. Sometimes you need to prompt “check the available MCP resources” explicitly.\n5. Not all hosts support it equally. Claude Desktop has full support. Third-party integrations are catching up.\nSecurity Considerations MCP gives AI models access to real systems. Take security seriously:\n1. Principle of least privilege. Your MCP server for database exploration should use a read-only database user. Don’t give Claude DROP TABLE permissions.\n2. Input validation. The model controls tool inputs. Validate everything. SQL injection is a real risk if you’re not careful.\n# Bad: Direct interpolation sql = f\"SELECT * FROM {arguments['table']}\" # Good: Whitelist validation allowed_tables = [\"users\", \"orders\", \"products\"] if arguments[\"table\"] not in allowed_tables: raise ValueError(\"Invalid table\") 3. Rate limiting. Models can call tools repeatedly. Implement rate limits to prevent runaway queries.\n4. Audit logging. Log every MCP call with timestamps and context. You’ll want this when debugging or investigating unexpected behavior.\n5. Network isolation. Run MCP servers with minimal network access. They shouldn’t be able to reach arbitrary endpoints.\nThe Bigger Picture MCP is part of a larger trend: AI systems becoming first-class participants in developer workflows, not just chat windows you paste into.\nWhere this leads:\nIDE integration. Your editor’s AI isn’t just autocompleting—it’s understanding your entire project, git history, and documentation.\nAgentic workflows. AI that can actually do things: run tests, check CI status, deploy to staging. MCP provides the plumbing.\nCustom enterprise AI. Organizations can expose internal knowledge bases, APIs, and databases to AI tools without sending data to external services.\nStandardization. MCP is open spec. If it gains adoption, we’ll see interoperability between AI tools that currently don’t talk to each other.\nThis is infrastructure work. It’s not as exciting as a new model release. But it’s what turns capable models into capable systems.\nGetting Started If you want to experiment:\nInstall Claude Desktop and enable MCP in settings Try existing servers: Filesystem, GitHub, and Postgres servers exist as reference implementations Build something small: Start with a read-only server exposing one data source Iterate on discovery: Watch how Claude explores resources and tune your server’s descriptions The learning curve is manageable if you’ve built APIs before. The mental shift is thinking about what context would help the model, then building servers to provide it.\nThe Bottom Line MCP solves the “context starvation” problem that limits current AI tools. It’s not a product—it’s infrastructure that makes better products possible.\nFor developers, the implications are:\nLess copy-paste, more integration AI tools that understand your environment, not generic examples Custom workflows that weren’t possible before If you’re building AI-powered developer tools, MCP is worth learning now. The ecosystem is early, but the direction is clear.\nAnd honestly? Building MCP servers is kind of fun. There’s something satisfying about giving Claude access to your systems and watching it figure things out.\n","wordCount":"1386","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://mhassan.dev/assets/mcp-protocol.jpg","datePublished":"2025-11-15T10:00:00+05:00","dateModified":"2025-11-15T10:00:00+05:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Muhammad Hassan Raza"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://mhassan.dev/blog/model-context-protocol/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Muhammad Hassan Raza","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://mhassan.dev/assets/favicon.svg"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://mhassan.dev/ accesskey=h title="Muhammad Hassan Raza (Alt + H)">Muhammad Hassan Raza</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">

Instead of explaining API semantics in every prompt, Claude can discover and call them directly.</p><p>At Entropy Labs, we built an MCP server for our internal APIs. Now Claude can check deployment status, query metrics, and look up customer data—all without manual copy-paste.</p><hr><h2 id=current-limitations><span style=color:#8ac7db>Current Limitations</span><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#current-limitations>#</a></h2><p>MCP is early-stage. Expect rough edges:</p><p><strong>1. Ecosystem is immature.</strong> Pre-built servers exist for common tools (filesystem, GitHub, Slack), but you&rsquo;ll write custom ones for anything domain-specific.</p><p><strong>2. Security requires thought.</strong> MCP servers have access to real systems. A poorly-written server can expose sensitive data or allow unintended actions. Audit carefully.</p><p><strong>3. Performance varies.</strong> Large resource lists or slow database queries can delay responses. Implement timeouts and pagination.</p><p><strong>4. Discovery UX is evolving.</strong> Models don&rsquo;t always explore available resources effectively. Sometimes you need to prompt &ldquo;check the available MCP resources&rdquo; explicitly.</p><p><strong>5. Not all hosts support it equally.</strong> Claude Desktop has full support. Third-party integrations are catching up.</p><hr><h2 id=security-considerations><span style=color:#ffb4a2>Security Considerations</span><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#security-considerations>#</a></h2><p>MCP gives AI models access to real systems. Take security seriously:</p><p><strong>1. Principle of least privilege.</strong> Your MCP server for database exploration should use a read-only database user. Don&rsquo;t give Claude DROP TABLE permissions.</p><p><strong>2. Input validation.</strong> The model controls tool inputs. Validate everything. SQL injection is a real risk if you&rsquo;re not careful.</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-python data-lang=python><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#75715e># Bad: Direct interpolation</span>

Audit logging.</strong> Log every MCP call with timestamps and context. You&rsquo;ll want this when debugging or investigating unexpected behavior.</p><p><strong>5. Network isolation.</strong> Run MCP servers with minimal network access. They shouldn&rsquo;t be able to reach arbitrary endpoints.</p><hr><h2 id=the-bigger-picture><span style=color:#8ac7db>The Bigger Picture</span><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-bigger-picture>#</a></h2><p>MCP is part of a larger trend: AI systems becoming first-class participants in developer workflows, not just chat windows you paste into.</p><p>Where this leads:</p><p><strong>IDE integration.</strong> Your editor&rsquo;s AI isn&rsquo;t just autocompleting—it&rsquo;s understanding your entire project, git history, and documentation.</p><p><strong>Agentic workflows.</strong> AI that can actually do things: run tests, check CI status, deploy to staging. MCP provides the plumbing.</p><p><strong>Custom enterprise AI.</strong> Organizations can expose internal knowledge bases, APIs, and databases to AI tools without sending data to external services.</p><p><strong>Standardization.</strong> MCP is open spec. If it gains adoption, we&rsquo;ll see interoperability between AI tools that currently don&rsquo;t talk to each other.</p><p>This is infrastructure work. It&rsquo;s not as exciting as a new model release. But it&rsquo;s what turns capable models into capable <em>systems</em>.</p><hr><h2 id=getting-started><span style=color:#ffb4a2>Getting Started</span><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#getting-started>#</a></h2><p>If you want to experiment:</p><ol><li><strong>Install Claude Desktop</strong> and enable MCP in settings</li><li><strong>Try existing servers:</strong> Filesystem, GitHub, and Postgres servers exist as reference implementations</li><li><strong>Build something small:</strong> Start with a read-only server exposing one data source</li><li><strong>Iterate on discovery:</strong> Watch how Claude explores resources and tune your server&rsquo;s descriptions</li></ol><p>The learning curve is manageable if you&rsquo;ve built APIs before. The mental shift is thinking about what context would help the model, then building servers to provide it.</p><hr><h2 id=the-bottom-line><span style=color:#8ac7db>The Bottom Line</span><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-bottom-line>#</a></h2><p>MCP solves the &ldquo;context starvation&rdquo; problem that limits current AI tools. It&rsquo;s not a product—it&rsquo;s infrastructure that makes better products possible.</p><p>For developers, the implications are:</p><ul><li>Less copy-paste, more integration</li><li>AI tools that understand your environment, not generic examples</li><li>Custom workflows that weren&rsquo;t possible before</li></ul><p>If you&rsquo;re building AI-powered developer tools, MCP is worth learning now. The ecosystem is early, but the direction is clear.</p><p>And honestly? Building MCP servers is kind of fun. There&rsquo;s something satisfying about giving Claude access to your systems and watching it figure things out.</p></div></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://mhassan.dev/tags/mcp>MCP</a></li><li><a href=https://mhassan.dev/tags/anthropic>Anthropic</a></li><li><a href=https://mhassan.dev/tags/ai>AI</a></li><li><a href=https://mhassan.dev/tags/protocol>Protocol</a></li><li><a href=https://mhassan.dev/tags/integration>Integration</a></li><li><a href=https://mhassan.dev/tags/developer-tools>Developer Tools</a></li><li><a href=https://mhassan.dev/tags/claude>Claude</a></li><li><a href=https://mhassan.dev/tags/api>API</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=next href=https://mhassan.dev/blog/extended-thinking-llms/><span class=title>Next »</span><br><span>Extended Thinking in LLMs: A Mental Model for Developers</span></a></nav></footer><div class=giscus-container><script src=https://giscus.app/client.js data-repo=M-Hassan-Raza/Portfolio data-repo-id=R_kgDON3Oajw data-category=General data-category-id=DIC_kwDON3Oaj84Cm3y9 data-mapping=pathname data-strict=0 data-reactions-enabled=1 data-emit-metadata=0 data-input-position=bottom data-theme=light data-lang=en crossorigin=anonymous async></script></div><script>function getTheme(){return document.body.classList.contains("dark")?"dark":"light"}function updateGiscusTheme(){const e=document.querySelector("iframe.giscus-frame");if(!e){setTimeout(updateGiscusTheme,300);return}const t=getTheme();e.contentWindow.postMessage({giscus:{setConfig:{theme:t}}},"https://giscus.app")}localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&updateGiscusTheme();const observer=new MutationObserver(()=>{updateGiscusTheme()});observer.observe(document.body,{attributes:!0,attributeFilter:["class"]})</script></article></main><footer class=footer><span>&copy; 2026 <a href=https://mhassan.dev/>Muhammad Hassan Raza</a></span> ·
