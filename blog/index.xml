If you've ever found yourself digging through product manuals, company
wikis, or lengthy documents just to find a simple answer, you know the pain.
The fact you're reading this suggests you're interested in how
&lt;strong&gt;Generative AI&lt;/strong&gt; can make that process less painful. Stick
around for a few minutes, and I'll walk you through how we built a smarter
FAQ bot using Google's Gemini API, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), and
structured output. This isn't just another chatbot; it's designed to give
&lt;strong&gt;reliable, context-aware answers&lt;/strong&gt; based &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; on
provided information, minimizing the risk of making things up
(hallucination). This example uses Google Car manuals, but the principles
apply anywhere you have a set of documents you need to query effectively.
I'm sharing my journey building this; it's a practical demonstration, not a
definitive guide, so adapt the ideas to your needs!

The fact that you have decided to read this behemoth of an article deserves admiration and tells me that you're serious about your academics and career (or are procrastinating on something else). Give me the next 20 mins of your life and I'll make you into a much more informed individual. Your &lt;strong&gt;Final Year Project (FYP)&lt;/strong&gt; is one of the most important academic tasks in your degree. It can shape your future career, boost your portfolio, and improve your problem-solving skills.
This guide will help you &lt;strong&gt;choose the right topic, advisor, tech stack, and strategy&lt;/strong&gt; to ensure your FYP stands out. This guide is mainly targets FASTians because of my experience, but the advice can be applied to any university. Also, I claim to be no expert in this field. I'm just a student who's been through the process and wants to help others navigate it. So take my very opinionated advice with a grain of salt.

&lt;p&gt;When planning your FYP, it’s essential to decide which type of project best aligns with your interests, skills, and career goals. Generally, there are two broad categories:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Optimizing Django ORM Queries for Large Applications</title><link>https://mhassan.dev/blog/django-orm-optimizaitons/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 12:00:00 +0500</pubDate><guid>https://mhassan.dev/blog/django-orm-optimizaitons/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As my POS system scaled, performance bottlenecks became increasingly apparent. Customers began complaining about slow bill generation times, which made checkout frustratingly sluggish. After profiling my Django APIs, I discovered that inefficient ORM queries were causing unnecessary database overhead, leading to significant slowdowns. This prompted a deep dive into ORM optimizations to reduce query execution time and improve the overall user experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll share how I optimized my Django ORM queries using &lt;code&gt;select_related&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;prefetch_related&lt;/code&gt;, bulk operations, and query profiling tools to enhance the efficiency of my refund API and bill generation process.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>How I Built My Portfolio Website with Hugo, GitHub Pages, and Free Tools</title><link>https://mhassan.dev/blog/free-website-hosting/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 14:00:00 +0500</pubDate><guid>https://mhassan.dev/blog/free-website-hosting/</guid><description>A detailed breakdown of how I built my personal portfolio website using Hugo, GitHub Pages, free analytics, and more.</description></item><item><title>Optimizing Django Signals for Efficient Ledger Recalculations</title><link>https://mhassan.dev/blog/using-signals-optimally/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 12:00:00 +0500</pubDate><guid>https://mhassan.dev/blog/using-signals-optimally/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When dealing with financial transactions in Django applications, maintaining an accurate ledger is critical. However, inefficient signal handling can lead to performance bottlenecks. In this article, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore an optimized approach to recalculating ledger balances while ensuring minimal database impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-problem"&gt;The Problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A typical ledger system requires recalculating balances when transactions are inserted, updated, or deleted. Using Django signals, many implementations trigger redundant recalculations, causing excessive database queries and slowing down the application.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Importance of Reusable Components for Critical Actions in VueJS</title><link>https://mhassan.dev/blog/reusing-components-benefits/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mhassan.dev/blog/reusing-components-benefits/</guid><description>Learn why creating reusable components—such as password confirmation modals, confirmation dialogs, and consistent button elements—is essential for maintaining a uniform and user-friendly interface in VueJS applications.</description></item><item><title>Advantages of Preloading Data on Page Load</title><link>https://mhassan.dev/blog/preloading-data-for-performance/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mhassan.dev/blog/preloading-data-for-performance/</guid><description>Discover how preloading data on page load enhances performance and improves user experience, particularly for pages like the generate invoice page where product data is loaded on mount.</description></item><item><title>Optimizing Django Performance: Lessons from a POS System</title><link>https://mhassan.dev/blog/optimizing-django-performance/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mhassan.dev/blog/optimizing-django-performance/</guid><description>A deep dive into optimizing Django backend performance for a POS system, covering bulk updates, caching, and efficient query handling.</description></item><item><title>Learn Web Development for Free: Platforms with Certificates (That Aren't Just Tutorials)</title><link>https://mhassan.dev/blog/web-dev-resources/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Jan 2025 17:27:00 +0500</pubDate><guid>https://mhassan.dev/blog/web-dev-resources/</guid><description>&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="introduction-moving-beyond-passive-learning"&gt;&lt;span style="color:#FFB4A2"&gt;Introduction: Moving Beyond Passive Learning&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;
If you're looking to learn web development, you've likely encountered the overwhelming sea of online resources. It's easy to get stuck in a cycle of watching tutorials, passively following along without truly internalizing the concepts or developing the ability to build independently. This phenomenon, often called "tutorial hell," can stall progress and hinder real skill development.
&lt;p&gt;The demand for skilled web developers remains high, and fortunately, quality education is increasingly accessible without the hefty price tag of traditional routes. Numerous free platforms offer comprehensive learning paths. However, simply having access to resources isn&amp;rsquo;t enough. Effective learning, especially in a practical field like web development, requires structure, hands-on application, and measurable progress.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Building a Smarter FAQ Bot (with Gemini, RAG, and Structured Output)</title><link>https://mhassan.dev/blog/smart-faq-bot-google-genai-intensive-course/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Aug 2024 10:00:00 +0500</pubDate><guid>https://mhassan.dev/blog/smart-faq-bot-google-genai-intensive-course/</guid><description>&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;
