&lt;p>The fact that you have actually decided to read this behemoth of an article deserves admiration, and tells me that you&amp;rsquo;re serious about your academics and career (or are procrastinating on something else). Give me the next 20 mins of your life and I&amp;rsquo;ll make you into a much more informed individual. Your &lt;strong>Final Year Project (FYP)&lt;/strong> is one of the most important academic tasks in your degree. It can shape your future career, boost your portfolio, and improve your problem-solving skills.&lt;br>
This guide will help you &lt;strong>choose the right topic, advisor, tech stack, and strategy&lt;/strong> to ensure your FYP stands out. Please note that this guide is mainly targeted towards FASTians because of my personal experience, but the advice can be applied to any university. Also, I claim to be no expert in this field. I&amp;rsquo;m just a student who&amp;rsquo;s been through the process and wants to help others navigate it. So take my very opinionated advice with a grain of salt.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Optimizing Django ORM Queries for Large Applications</title><link>https://mhassan.dev/blog/django-orm-optimizaitons/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2025 12:00:00 +0500</pubDate><guid>https://mhassan.dev/blog/django-orm-optimizaitons/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As my POS system scaled, performance bottlenecks became increasingly apparent. Customers began complaining about slow bill generation times, which made checkout frustratingly sluggish. After profiling my Django APIs, I discovered that inefficient ORM queries were causing unnecessary database overhead, leading to significant slowdowns. This prompted a deep dive into ORM optimizations to reduce query execution time and improve the overall user experience.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll share how I optimized my Django ORM queries using &lt;code>select_related&lt;/code>, &lt;code>prefetch_related&lt;/code>, bulk operations, and query profiling tools to enhance the efficiency of my refund API and bill generation process.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How I Built My Portfolio Website with Hugo, GitHub Pages, and Free Tools</title><link>https://mhassan.dev/blog/free-website-hosting/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 14:00:00 +0500</pubDate><guid>https://mhassan.dev/blog/free-website-hosting/</guid><description>A detailed breakdown of how I built my personal portfolio website using Hugo, GitHub Pages, free analytics, and more.</description></item><item><title>Optimizing Django Signals for Efficient Ledger Recalculations</title><link>https://mhassan.dev/blog/using-signals-optimally/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 12:00:00 +0500</pubDate><guid>https://mhassan.dev/blog/using-signals-optimally/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When dealing with financial transactions in Django applications, maintaining an accurate ledger is critical. However, inefficient signal handling can lead to performance bottlenecks. In this article, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore an optimized approach to recalculating ledger balances while ensuring minimal database impact.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-problem">The Problem&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A typical ledger system requires recalculating balances when transactions are inserted, updated, or deleted. Using Django signals, many implementations trigger redundant recalculations, causing excessive database queries and slowing down the application.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Importance of Reusable Components for Critical Actions in VueJS</title><link>https://mhassan.dev/blog/reusing-components-benefits/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mhassan.dev/blog/reusing-components-benefits/</guid><description>Learn why creating reusable components—such as password confirmation modals, confirmation dialogs, and consistent button elements—is essential for maintaining a uniform and user-friendly interface in VueJS applications.</description></item><item><title>Advantages of Preloading Data on Page Load</title><link>https://mhassan.dev/blog/preloading-data-for-performance/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mhassan.dev/blog/preloading-data-for-performance/</guid><description>Discover how preloading data on page load enhances performance and improves user experience, particularly for pages like the generate invoice page where product data is loaded on mount.</description></item><item><title>Optimizing Django Performance: Lessons from a POS System</title><link>https://mhassan.dev/blog/optimizing-django-performance/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mhassan.dev/blog/optimizing-django-performance/</guid><description>A deep dive into optimizing Django backend performance for a POS system, covering bulk updates, caching, and efficient query handling.</description></item></channel></rss>
