This example uses Google Car manuals, but the principles apply anywhere you have a set of documents you need to query effectively. I'm sharing my journey building this; it's a practical demonstration, not a definitive guide, so adapt the ideas to your needs! The Problem: Dumb Bots and Information Overload Traditional search methods or basic chatbots often fall short when dealing with specific document sets:\nInformation Overload: Manually searching large documents is time-consuming and inefficient. Generic LLM Limitations: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful, but they lack specific, up-to-date knowledge about your documents unless explicitly trained on them (which is often impractical). Hallucination Risk: When asked about information outside their training data, LLMs might confidently invent answers that sound plausible but are incorrect. This is unacceptable for reliable FAQ systems. Inconsistent Outputs: Getting answers in a usable, predictable format can be challenging with free-form text generation. We need a system that answers questions accurately based only on a given set of documents and provides answers in a consistent, structured way.\nThe Solution: RAG + Gemini API Our approach combines Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with the capabilities of the Gemini API:\nRAG Pipeline: This involves three main steps:\nIndexing: Convert the source documents (Google Car manuals) into numerical representations (embeddings) using the Gemini text-embedding-004 model and store them in a vector database (ChromaDB). This allows for efficient similarity searches. Retrieval: When a user asks a question, embed the question using the same model and search the vector database to find the most relevant document chunks. Generation: Pass the original question and the retrieved document chunks as context to a powerful LLM (like gemini-2.0-flash). Instruct the model to answer the question based only on the provided context. Gemini API Features:\nHigh-Quality Embeddings: text-embedding-004 provides embeddings suitable for finding semantically similar text. Powerful Generation: gemini-2.0-flash can synthesize answers based on the retrieved context. Structured Output (JSON Mode): We instruct Gemini to return the answer and a confidence score in a predictable JSON format, making it easy for applications to use the output. Optional Grounding: We can even add Google Search as a tool if the local documents don’t suffice (though our primary goal here is document-based Q\u0026A). Implementation Highlights Here are some key code snippets demonstrating the core components:\n1. Custom Embedding Function for ChromaDB: We need to tell ChromaDB how to generate embeddings using the Gemini API.\n# --- 4. Define Gemini Embedding Function for ChromaDB --- from chromadb import Documents, EmbeddingFunction, Embeddings from google.api_core import retry from google import genai from google.genai import types is_retriable = lambda e: (isinstance(e, genai.errors.APIError) and e.code in {429, 503}) class GeminiEmbeddingFunction(EmbeddingFunction): document_mode = True # Toggle between indexing docs and embedding queries @retry.Retry(predicate=is_retriable) def __call__(self, input_texts: Documents) -\u003e Embeddings: task = \"retrieval_document\" if self.document_mode else \"retrieval_query\" print(f\"Embedding {'documents' if self.document_mode else 'query'} ({len(input_texts)})...\") try: response = client.models.embed_content( model=\"models/text-embedding-004\", contents=input_texts, config=types.EmbedContentConfig(task_type=task), # Specify task type ) return [e.values for e in response.embeddings] except Exception as e: print(f\"Error during embedding: {e}\") return [[] for _ in input_texts] 2. Setting up ChromaDB and Indexing: We create a ChromaDB collection and add our documents. get_or_create_collection makes this idempotent.\n# --- 5. Setup ChromaDB Vector Store --- import chromadb import time print(\"Setting up ChromaDB...\") DB_NAME = \"googlecar_faq_db\" embed_fn = GeminiEmbeddingFunction() chroma_client = chromadb.Client() # In-memory client try: db = chroma_client.get_or_create_collection(name=DB_NAME, embedding_function=embed_fn) print(f\"Collection '{DB_NAME}' ready. Current count: {db.count()}\") if db.count() \u003c len(documents): print(f\"Adding/Updating documents in '{DB_NAME}'...\") embed_fn.document_mode = True # Set mode for indexing db.upsert(documents=documents, ids=doc_ids) # Use upsert for safety time.sleep(2) # Allow indexing to settle print(f\"Documents added/updated. New count: {db.count()}\") else: print(\"Documents already seem to be indexed.\") except Exception as e: print(f\"Error setting up ChromaDB collection: {e}\") raise SystemExit(\"ChromaDB setup failed. Exiting.\") 3. Retrieving Relevant Documents: This function takes the user query, embeds it (using document_mode=False), and searches ChromaDB.\n# --- 6. Define Retrieval Function --- def retrieve_documents(query: str, n_results: int = 1) -\u003e list[str]: print(f\"\\nRetrieving documents for query: '{query}'\") embed_fn.document_mode = False # Switch to query mode try: results = db.query(query_texts=[query], n_results=n_results) if results and results.get('documents'): retrieved_docs = results['documents'][0] print(f\"Retrieved {len(retrieved_docs)} documents.\") return retrieved_docs else: print(\"No documents retrieved.\") return [] except Exception as e: print(f\"Error querying ChromaDB: {e}\") return [] 4. Generating the Structured Answer: Here’s the core logic combining the query, retrieved context, and instructions for the LLM, specifying JSON output with a confidence score.\n# --- 7. Define Structured Output Schema --- from typing_extensions import Literal from pydantic import BaseModel class AnswerWithConfidence(BaseModel): answer: str confidence: Literal[\"High\", \"Medium\", \"Low\"] # --- 8. Define Augmented Generation Function --- def generate_structured_answer(query: str, context_docs: list[str]) -\u003e dict | None: # ... (prompt construction as shown previously) ... prompt = f\"\"\"You are an AI assistant answering questions about a Google car based ONLY on the provided documents. Context Documents: --- {context} --- Question: {query} Based *only* on the information in the context documents above, answer the question. Also, assess your confidence in the answer based *only* on the provided text: - \"High\" if the answer is directly and clearly stated in the documents. - \"Medium\" if the answer can be inferred but isn't explicitly stated. - \"Low\" if the documents don't seem to contain the answer or are ambiguous. Return your response ONLY as a JSON object with the keys \"answer\" and \"confidence\". Example format: {{ \"answer\": \"Your answer here.\", \"confidence\": \"High/Medium/Low\" }} \"\"\" try: generation_config = types.GenerateContentConfig( temperature=0.2, response_mime_type=\"application/json\", # Request JSON response_schema=AnswerWithConfidence # Provide the schema ) response = client.models.generate_content( model=\"gemini-2.0-flash\", contents=prompt, config=generation_config # Pass the config object ) # ... (response handling as shown previously) ... # Safe access to parsed output if response.candidates and response.candidates[0].content and response.candidates[0].content.parts: parsed_output = response.candidates[0].content.parts[0].parsed if isinstance(parsed_output, dict) and \"answer\" in parsed_output and \"confidence\" in parsed_output: return parsed_output # ... (Error handling/logging) ... return {\"answer\": \"Error: Could not generate/parse structured response.\", \"confidence\": \"Low\"} except Exception as e: print(f\"Error during content generation call: {e}\") return {\"answer\": f\"Error during generation API call: {e}\", \"confidence\": \"Low\"} Tip: Ensure your API key is correctly set up in Kaggle Secrets (GOOGLE_API_KEY). Also, ChromaDB setup might require specific permissions or setup depending on the environment (here we use an in-memory one for simplicity).\nWhy Structured Output and Confidence Scores? Forcing the LLM to output JSON with a specific schema (using response_mime_type and response_schema) brings several advantages:\nReliability: The output format is predictable, making it easy to integrate into downstream applications without complex text parsing. Consistency: Ensures the bot always provides both the answer and its confidence level. Trustworthiness: The confidence score gives the user (or the calling application) an indication of how much to trust the answer, based on the grounding provided by the retrieved documents. A “Low” confidence answer might trigger a fallback to human support or a broader search. Limitations and Future Work This implementation is a great starting point, but it has limitations:\nDocument Quality: The RAG system’s effectiveness heavily depends on the quality, relevance, and comprehensiveness of the indexed documents. Garbage in, garbage out. Retrieval Accuracy: Simple similarity search might not always retrieve the perfect chunk of text, especially for complex queries. More advanced retrieval strategies (like hybrid search or re-ranking) could improve this. Structured Output Failures: While JSON mode is robust, the LLM might occasionally fail to generate perfectly valid JSON matching the schema. More robust error handling and potentially retries could be added. Limited Context Handling (within LLM): While RAG provides context, the LLM itself still has limits on how much context it can process effectively in a single generation step. Very long retrieved passages might need summarization or chunking before being sent to the LLM. Static Knowledge: The bot only knows what’s in the ChromaDB index. It doesn’t learn automatically. Updates require re-indexing. Future Enhancements:\nImplement Google Search grounding as a fallback when confidence is low or documents are missing. Add conversation memory for multi-turn interactions. Explore more sophisticated retrieval techniques. Build a simple UI (e.g., using Gradio or Streamlit). Fine-tune an embedding model specifically for the car manual domain (though text-embedding-004 is quite capable). Conclusion Building this FAQ bot demonstrates how combining RAG with Gemini’s embedding and generation capabilities, especially its structured output mode, can create powerful and reliable AI-driven Q\u0026A systems. By grounding the LLM’s responses in specific source documents and requesting a confidence score, we significantly mitigate hallucination and provide a more trustworthy user experience.\nKey Takeaways:\nRAG grounds LLM answers in your specific data. Gemini Embeddings + ChromaDB enable efficient document retrieval. Structured Output (JSON Mode) enhances reliability and integrability. Confidence Scores add a layer of trustworthiness. This approach is versatile and can be adapted for various knowledge bases, from customer support FAQs to internal documentation search.\nI hope this walkthrough provides a clear picture of how this smarter FAQ bot works!

through product manuals, company wikis, or lengthy documents just to find a simple answer, you know the pain. The fact you're reading this suggests you're interested in how **Generative AI** can make that process less painful. Stick around for a few minutes, and I'll walk you through how we built a smarter FAQ bot using Google's Gemini API, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), and structured output. This isn't just another chatbot; it's designed to give **reliable, context-aware answers** based *only* on provided information, minimizing the risk of making things up (hallucination). This example uses Google Car manuals, but the principles apply anywhere you have a set of documents you need to query effectively. I'm sharing my journey building this; it's a practical demonstration, not a definitive guide, so adapt the ideas to your needs!</div><hr><h2 id=the-problem-dumb-bots-and-information-overload><span style=color:#ffb4a2>The Problem: Dumb Bots and Information Overload</span><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-problem-dumb-bots-and-information-overload>#</a></h2><p>Traditional search methods or basic chatbots often fall short when dealing with specific document sets:</p><ul><li><strong><span style=color:#8ac7db>Information Overload:</span></strong> Manually searching large documents is time-consuming and inefficient.</li><li><strong><span style=color:#8ac7db>Generic LLM Limitations:</span></strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful, but they lack specific, up-to-date knowledge about <em>your</em> documents unless explicitly trained on them (which is often impractical).</li><li><strong><span style=color:#8ac7db>Hallucination Risk:</span></strong> When asked about information outside their training data, LLMs might confidently invent answers that sound plausible but are incorrect.

Garbage in, garbage out.</li><li><strong><span style=color:#8ac7db>Retrieval Accuracy:</span></strong> Simple similarity search might not always retrieve the <em>perfect</em> chunk of text, especially for complex queries. More advanced retrieval strategies (like hybrid search or re-ranking) could improve this.</li><li><strong><span style=color:#8ac7db>Structured Output Failures:</span></strong> While JSON mode is robust, the LLM might occasionally fail to generate perfectly valid JSON matching the schema. More robust error handling and potentially retries could be added.</li><li><strong><span style=color:#8ac7db>Limited Context Handling (within LLM):</span></strong> While RAG provides context, the LLM itself still has limits on how much context it can process <em>effectively</em> in a single generation step. Very long retrieved passages might need summarization or chunking before being sent to the LLM.</li><li><strong><span style=color:#8ac7db>Static Knowledge:</span></strong> The bot only knows what&rsquo;s in the ChromaDB index. It doesn&rsquo;t learn automatically.
